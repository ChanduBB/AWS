To restrict access to AWS S3 to a particular IP address, you can create an S3 bucket policy that allows access only from that IP address. Here are the steps:

Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the S3 console.
Select the S3 bucket for which you want to restrict access.
Click on the "Permissions" tab, and then click on the "Bucket Policy" button.
In the bucket policy editor, add the following policy:

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Id": "mybucketpolicy",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::mybucket/*",
      "Condition": {
        "IpAddress": {
          "aws:SourceIp": "x.x.x.x"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
Replace "mybucket" with the name of your bucket and "x.x.x.x" with the IP address you want to allow access from.

Click on the "Save" button to save the policy.
After creating this policy, access to the S3 bucket will be allowed only from the specified IP address.
