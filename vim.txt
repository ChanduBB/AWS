	gg: Move to the beginning of the file.
	Editing Text:

	i: Enter insert mode before the cursor.
	I: Enter insert mode at the beginning of the current line.
	a: Enter insert mode after the cursor.
	A: Enter insert mode at the end of the current line.
	o: Open a new line below the current line.

	x: Delete the character under the cursor.
	dd: Delete the current line.
	yy: Copy (yank) the current line.

	N: Move to the previous occurrence in the current direction.
	:s/old/new: Replace "old" with "new" on the current line.
	:%s/old/new/g: Replace "old" with "new" in the entire file.
	:n: Go to a specific line number (replace "n" with the line number).
	Saving and Quitting:

	:w: Save changes.
	:q: Quit (if no changes were made).
	:q!: Quit without saving changes.
	:wq or ZZ: Save and quit.
	Other Useful Commands:

	u: Undo the last change.
	Ctrl-R: Redo.
	.: Repeat the last change.
	:e filename: Open another file for editing.
	:w filename: Save the current file with a different name.
	These are some of the fundamental Vi editor commands. Vi can be quite powerful, but it has a learning curve. To learn more, you can use vimtutor, a built-in tutorial for Vim (an improved version of Vi), or refer to the Vi or Vim documentation (man vi or man vim).
