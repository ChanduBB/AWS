If you create NAT gateway in and attach it to private subnet and create a VM in that private subnet with elastic or public ip and try to access with that public ip, you wont be able to.
If you have a private IP address you will be able to connect to that private instance.
If you doesnt allow all trafic you can still download packages.
If you want to connect to pri VM which doesnt have public IP through JPserver you must allow Jpserver private IP in private Vm.
If you have private instance and want to access Internet then, either you should have NAT Gateway or Pulblic IP for instance. any one of them are enough.
