Creating and mounting EBS volume onto linux machine:

1. First create a linux EC2 instance, by default you will get some range of EBS volume based on which server you have choosed. I have launched an ec2 instance which contains 8GB storage by default.
2. To create a new EBS volume, goto --> Volumes --> select volume type, size and AZ according to the requirement, for example select 20GB size and click on create volume.
3. we can see a new volume created in volumes and it will be in a available state not "in-use". to mount the volume to an instance we need to attatch that volume to a particular ec2 instance which you want to attach.
4. To attach a volume goto --> volumes and select volume --> click on --> actions and attach volume, select the instance which you want to attach, choose device path thenclick Attach. Now you will see the volume state in-use.
5. Connect to linux server with the instance, then type <df-h> to check the disk space and memory usage mount paths, you wont see the new volume attached to the instance. 
6. type <lsblk> to check Disk, drives and partitions. you can see the new volume here.
7. type <file -s /dev/xvdf> --> here xvdf is the name of new volume. if you get "data" after executing this command then you have to setup file system for the block device
8. To create a file sysytem execute a command --> mkfs -t xfs /dev/xvdf 
9. execute <file -s /dev/xvdf> command again to check the file system 
10. Create two directories in root --> <mkdir -p /volume/newvolume>
11. Mount the volume to the newely created directories --> <mount /dev/xvdf /volume/newvolume> xvdf is the volume name and dev is te path where xvdf located and we are mounting that volume from that place to newely created directories.
12. Now check whether the volume added to the instance or not --> <df -h> you will see that volume and mounting point is /volume/newvolume without restarting the instance.
13. For unmounting use this command --> <umount /dev/xvdf> here, xvdf is device name.
*******Permanent way to mount*******
Open <vi /etc/fstab> file and add </dev/xvdf        /volume/newvolume      xfs     defaults,nofail 0 0>  Here, /dev/xvdf is device or volume name and /volume/newvolume is mount point(dest).
Execute a command to get mounted <mount -a>. To check mounted or not <df -h>
								 
<df -h>  <mkfs -t xfs /dev/xvdf>  <file -s /dev/xvdf> <mkdir -p /newdir/newdir11>  <lsblk>  <mount /dev/xvdf /newdir/newdir11/>  <umount /dev/xvdf>

To checck the mounted columes and path --->> cat /etc/exports
*******Windows EBS ******
1. Launch a windows machoine and choose server goto --> actions --> select security --> click on get windows password then add your pem key, click on decrypy password then you will be getting a username and password copy that. create a EBS in aws and attach to windows machine.
2. Run a command in local window --> mstsc --> give th ewindows credentials to connect. 
3. once enter into the windows server Run a command <diskmgmt.msc> then you will be see 2 disks disk 0 and disk 1 
4. click on disk 1 which is a new volume and bring it online and again click on disk 1 click on initial Diskclick OK.
5.click beside disk 1 click next next next now you can give a name to your new volume then clikc finish. goto files and check.
