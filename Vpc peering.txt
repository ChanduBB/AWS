Goto aws and create 2 vpc's
goto vpc --> give vpc name --> give CIDR blocks - i'm giving CIDR range as <10.1.0.0/24> and create vpc.
create 2nd vpc by following same steps as above and give CIDR range as <10.2.0.0/24>.
Goto subnets --> create subnet--> select a vpc in wich you want to create subnet --> give subnet name --> select AZ, here im selecting AZ 1a --> devide the 10.1.0.0/24 CIDR into 2 subnets. < 10.1.0.0/25 and 10.1.0.128/25> and give <10.1.0.0/25>CIDR fo rfirst subnet then create another in differenrt AZb and give CIDR range as <10.1.0.128/25>
Goto Internet gateway and click create -->give a name --> after IGW created select the IGW click attach and attach to a desired VPC.
Goto route tables --> give name and select VPC.
Goto route table and edit it by giving destinations whether local IG, IGW or NATGW. After that again goto route table --> click subnet associations--> select desired subnets which you want to attch this route table with those subnets and click save.
Goto peering connection --> give a name --> select <Requester VPC ID>,--> select <Accepter VPC ID> click on create .
Create a route table select VPC 1 ID and give 2 VPC CIDRs EX: <10.1.0.0/24> <-- first VPC CIDR and <10.2.0.0/24> <-- 2nd VPC CIDR, once you give the destinantoin of 2nd vpc CIDR mention Peering Connection as target then add subnets into that route table.
Create another Route table same as above and select VPC 2 and follow above route steps.
Create 2 instances. first instance with VPC-1 and second instance with VPC-2
Make sure to allow <All ICMP - IPv4> in security Groups.
