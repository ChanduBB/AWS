How to configure password-less (.pem key) authentication in a Linux physical server

In this article, we will show you how to set up password-less login on RHEL such as CentOS, Fedora, Rocky Linux & AlmaLinux, and Debian-based such as Ubuntu & Mint using .PEM key to connect to remote Linux servers.

Below are the steps.

Create a standard user in the Machine
Generate SSH RSA key for the user.
Convert RSA key to a .pem file
Change the sshd_config file. and restart the sshd service.
Create a standard user in the Machine and add a user in the wheel group.

# useradd admin
# passwd admin
Changing password for user admin.
New password:
BAD PASSWORD: The password is shorter than 8 characters
Retype new password:
passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully.

Add user in Wheel group via using usermod command.

# usermod –aG wheel admin
# id admin
uid=1001(admin) gid=1001(admin) groups=1001(admin),10(wheel)

now login via admin user and create an RSA key using the ssh-keygen command.

$ ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/admin/.ssh/id_rsa): admin
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in admin.
Your public key has been saved in admin.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:10tJj+1jaXiqiyQDZRWmVlntK6G4iDvwyO13c31EkB8 admin@localhost.localdomain
The key’s randomart image is:
+ — -[RSA 2048] — — +
| =+… |
| =. o.E |
| = .+ . |
| + .o.B |
| . .S…*.o |
|. .. …..= . |
|.+.. .o.. ..+ B |
|..+….* o . * . |
| o+. . + ooo |
+ — — [SHA256] — — -+
$ ls
admin admin.pub

once the RSA key is created copy private key to .PEM file.

$ cat admin > admin.pem
NOTE: Copy above admin.pem file to another system for login.

Create .ssh Folder with below permission
$ mkdir .ssh
$ chmod 700 .ssh
$ cat admin.pub > .ssh/authorized_keys

$ chmod 600 .ssh/authorized_keys

Logout from admin user and change setting in sudoers (/etc/sudoers) enable no password from wheel groups member.

# cat /etc/sudoers

## Allows people in group wheel to run all commands
#%wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL
## Same thing without a password
%wheel ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
## Allows members of the users group to mount and unmount the

Disable the password authentication in /etc/ssh/sshd_config file and restart sshd service

# cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config

# To disable tunneled clear text passwords, change to no here!
#PasswordAuthentication yes
#PermitEmptyPasswords no
PasswordAuthentication no
# Change to no to disable s/key passwords
#ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes

# systemctl restart sshd

Now Try to ssh login with another system via pem key.

# chmod 400 admin.pem

# ssh -i admin.pem admin@servera
